Hello,

I wanted to make a quick blog post regarding my decision to archive the MyStudio IDE project.

This project has been a huge learning opportunity for me in terms of developing GUI applications, GTK toolkit, and Rust programming language.

The IDE is more than 2 years old and was a fun little project to pick up and work on on and off. As one might've noticed, there haven't been any new commits since February.

I would like to thank the "*Rust India Telegram group"* for guiding me with a feature I had originally planned. Their insight into the problem made me realise some major architecture-level problems needed to be fixed.

This means a rewrite of the project was necessary but that requires a deeper understanding of multi-threaded applications and async Rust.

After a lot of R&D on this a few times in the past year, I realised I need to learn more to develop it at a level I can be proud of and make this IDE worth someone's time. I couldn't write a half-baked code on a project I love.

Hence, it is with a heavy heart, this project has reached its end on 11 November 2023. The project's GitHub repo has also been archived.

I might work on something else in the future and it *could* be an IDE but nothing's set in stone yet.

Thank you for your time!

Happy Diwali to you and your family! ðŸª”

Bye for now :-)
